PLEASE READ! (Message was sent to TA and Prof, Nov 11th)
Hello,

I was trying to reupload my excel file for A2, and noticed that the submission window had closed. I saw earlier today that it was accepting late submissions up to 11:00pm tonight. I understand that my assignment is late and may be subject to late penalties. I apologize and ask that you please accept my attached excel file.

Thank you for your consideration,

Alexander Lako 101186147
